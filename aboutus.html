            <p class="introduction"> <em>WHO WE ARE?</em>
                Breaking Barriers is a brand of physical and mental health care where its main service is sports and nutritional coaching.
                His creator, Facundo Castro Martinez, take his experience in the fittnes lifestyle as a starting point to break down barriers and educate about the way we transform our bodies and minds from a balanced and disciplined point of view. 
                His passion for the sport, his years of experience and training make him the ideal coach with whom to start a new lifestyle.
                He worked with thousands of clients, helping them reach their personal fitness goals.
                He is a coach dedicated to helping you
                reach your goals, whether that's a specific weight loss goal or muscle-building goal.
                There's not a one-size-fits-all approach to training, fitness, and nutrition, so I don't offer one. Instead, you'll have the option to connect with me directly, through one-on-one coaching, join one of my online Teams where you get a less personal service (but still an amazingly effective program) for a fraction of the cost, and you can even buy a training plan if you're someone that likes to simply follow a program without coaching or community. All three can be effective, so just decide what will work best for you and we'll support you.
                Whether you're gearing up for competition prep, motivated to step on stage and compete in bodybuilding, or just want to be fit, happy, and healthy, We believe we can help you.
                This won't be easy and we don't believe in a silver bullet to achieving your goals or taking shortcuts to get there. But, what we do here works and our approach prioritizes sustainability and long-term results.
